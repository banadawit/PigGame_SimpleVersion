   This is a simple Pig game where the first player rolls the dice randomly,
   and the result is displayed. If the current roll is a one, 
   the rolled value is discarded, and the turn is passed to the next player. 
   If the player holds the current value before rolling a one, that value is added to their score. 
   The game continues like this until one player reaches a score of 100, at which point they win the game.
